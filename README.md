no need for chatroom

just a roster for "currently at the gym" people who are looking for belay partners. 

username, availability/status at the gym, toprope or lead

bonus feature: ability to ping the user.. 
if someone sees someone they want to belay/climb with, they can send a request which will notify the other user. 

user A goes to the URL and sets their status at the gym. 
(name, if they're at the gym and when they plan on leaving, certifications)

user B sees user A on a roster on the website and can sent a notification to climb with them. 

user A will then get a push notification to their phone.. maybe we can use a text message api?
